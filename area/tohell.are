sword~
The blade of the sword is a full meter long and straight as an arrow, with
lightly-fluted sides.  Both edges are keened down to perfect lines, invisibly
sharp.  Perfection like this could have only been forged by a god.  The black
hilt is contrasted only by the faint symbol of a white arrow.
Upon the blade is engraved a poem:

                      Farslayer howls across the world
                      For thy heart, for thy heart, who hast wronged me!
                      Vengeance is his who casts the blade

Desc You are standing in Hiramoto's Buy & Sell. This poor bastard has
been damned to Hell to serve the public for eternity. He will buy most
anything you have, since business is slow. Not many people visit
Hell. The store is filled with worthless junk. Piles of aluminum balls,
and bottle cap collections fill the corners of the room. Junk of
all kinds is scattered about the store.
