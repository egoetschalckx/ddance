Desc You are in a long well lit hallway leading east and west. The walls here
are a milky white color, and glow with a warm luminescence, as does the
floor. A feeling of goodness permeates the area, and you feel unworthy to
tread upon these sacred floors.
  A huge set of double doors in finely worked ivory can be seen to the west.

Name An antechamber~
Desc You are in a small antechamber. It is well lit here, though the source
of light cannot be seen. It is almost as if the room itself exudes a warm
glow of goodness. A larger chamber can be seen to the west, but you do not
feel worthy to pass into it.

Vnum 1469
Name The chamber of the white light~
Desc You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an unknown
metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark. A flickering
flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of darkness and
cleansing the room of any evil. You feel a slight tug at your being as the
flame flickers towards you.

Desc You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
from a single enormous emerald.
