simply by typing "train" and then the 3 letters for the particular stat you
wish to raise.  (Str for strength, wis for wisdom, etc).  All stats have a
max of 40.  It is suggested you max your wisdom first, and then constitution
if you are a warrior, intelligence if a mage.  "Gain convert" will change 10

booth walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood,
rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival

Name The Inn~
Desc You are standing upstairs from Andy's Pub at Andy's Inn.  A few chairs
and a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large
stone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A
large oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with
wire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.
He looks up as you enter the room.  He looks at you quizzically.  He is
probably waiting for you to ask him for a room.

Name Before the Codex~
Desc The codex of ultimate wisdom rests upon a small pedestal in the middle of
this room.  In every direction that you look you can see stars, so many that
the mind struggles to comprehend the sheer numbers of them.  The ground
seems to be made of a strange ethereal material, clear and insubstantial,
and yet it supports your weight.  You feel as though you have entered into
the center of the universe, and that this is the unseen source of wisdom and
order throughout the world.
