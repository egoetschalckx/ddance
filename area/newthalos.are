partying here.

Desc Nowhere have you seen such an obscene display of wealth than in this
corridor. The shag carpeting under your feet makes it seem as if you are
walking on a cloud. Platinum candelabras hang delicately from the ceiling
casting light on the ancient tapestries adorning the walls. The crick
in your neck tells you it's time to stop staring. To the west the
numerous halls of the palace begin and the gate lies to the east.

Desc This is the room where the Sultan keeps the beautiful women of his palace.
There are ten girls here lying about the room dressed in silks you can
almost see through. In the western end of the room stands a large mound
of pillows and a beautiful young maiden sits perched atop. It is
unfortunate for you that only the Sultan is allowed in here.

Name Saska's Library~
Desc Fine, golden dust swirls and then settles as you enter Saska's
library. Leatherbound volumes of Shakespeare rest next to paperbacks by
Tom Robbins, and Toni Morrison's _Sula_ is open on the striking table: an
antique birdbath of polished blond wood, with glass set over the waterwell
to give the appearance of a perfectly still pool.  Trinkets, lightly
lifted from the mantles of the wealthy whose chimneys she cleaned, line
the windowsills and create space between the different sections of books.
A crystal oil lamp seems to float on the table; a piece of paper on the
wall, written in Saska's own lingering script, reads: "For what is your friend
that you would seek him with hours to kill?  Seek him always with hours to
live.  --Kahlil Gibran."
    A cat purrs somewhere, though you cannot see the source, and you feel
yourself tugged into the softened space. Have a seat in one of the enormous
papasan chairs, and choose a title that strikes you.
