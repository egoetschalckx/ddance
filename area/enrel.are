book1~
For many generations the people of Enrel had fought with the draconians
in the northern mountains, until they finally were driven from their homes,
being outnumbered and the draconians being a particularly strong and fierce
race.  The people of Enrel sought release from the many years of fighting at
the base of the mountains where the snows smelt to make a river, and empty
into the sea.  But the great leaders of Enrel had perished in the battles
with the draconians, leaving the people without leadership.  Soon rival
clans emerged, struggling for power.  The weaker clans perished, and the
ones that grew were the ones that were the most vile, and the most
bloodthirsty.  Chaos spread through the lands.  (To continue reading, look

Aidos lived many years as king, and guided the people of Enrel into
several generations of peace and prosperity.  His, truly, were the golden
days of the kingdom.  But then a shadow came on the valley in which the
people made their kingdom during the reign of Thereus.  A band of highly
organized warriors called the "Duergar" began plundering the outer villages,
forever pushing closer to the capital.  The Duergar were powerful men,
standing 9 to 10 feet high and muscled like no other stock of men.  But some
believed they were more beast than man, for they grew large amounts of hair
on their bodies, and spoke a very crude language.  (To read more, please go

book2~
Just as things seemed darkest, and lawlessness and chaos were at their
heighth, a man of great valor but also of great wisdom and compassion rose
up, and called for an end to the rival clans, that the bloodshed may cease. 
His name was Aidos, and after his long battle with the clan lords, he became
the first king of Enrel.  He handed the crown to his most trusted general,
but the people insisted that he lead them.  Thus Aidos became the first
king.  (To read more, look book3)

book~
The humans of the northern mountains, being forced out of their homes
after many years of war with the legions of dragon warriors, came to the
base of the mountain to escape from a life of constant warfare and strife. 
But there was chaos in those days for the great leaders were slain in battle
with the dragon warriors, and no man led the people of Enrel.  Disorder
swept throughout the lands, and rival clans emerged, looting and burning the
poor and defenseless.  Those were dark days in the history of Enrel.  [to

What happened to the remnants of the Duergar is not known, although in
almost 10 years time there hasn't been a single raid.  Many believe the
weakened Duergar party was eliminated by the dragon warriors in the northern
mountains, but many others still watch for the return of the Duergar.  
~
ExtraDesc
book4~
And it came to pass that the Duergar threatened the kingdom, so king
Thereus sent a dispatch of soldiers to deal with what was at first believed
to be a small problem.  The dispatch never returned.  The threat of the
Duergar grew ever larger, so Thereus took many of his best men to meet the
engage the Duergar.  Although never destroyed, the Duergar retreated to the
northern mountains.  Only 1 out of 10 men that undertook the mission to
purge the lands of the Duergar returned, and the battle was never spoken of,
nor written of by any of the survivors of that battle.  What truly happened
will always be a mystery.  (To read more, see book5)
