into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.

Looking around, you realize that some bizarre and horrible creature uses this
cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.
