the press of bodies.  The door at the end of the hall is huge.  You can see

guards it is incredibly hard to progress further down the hallway.  Even if
you did manage to break through the massive door would surely stop you.  It
stands well over 10 feet tall and is made out of solid steel.  A makeshift
baracade has been set up around it but it doesn't seem to be very effective.

door must be at least three feet thick of solid steel.  That amount of
defense would resist everything up to mass disruptor fire from a starship. 
Aside from the door there is the problem of the heavy troopers guarding it. 
They look much more formidable than they usual clan guards.

Name The northeast corner of the grounds~
Desc Piled up in this corner are mounds and mounds of broken equipment. 
Everything from swords to full body armors lay shattered in their heaps. 
There is a guard here trying to organzie the piles but he doesn't seem to be
having much luck.  The metal of the broken equipment is generally used to
make the massive clan robot guards.

disruptors this place has everything.  However, most of this has been taken
for reserves.  In front of you is a training robot used to practice your

taken little intrest in the fighting on the street and simply walled

Vnum 11142
Name The fourth floor of the tower~
Desc Again you see a long hallway stretched out in front of you.  As usual
there is a figure standing in the middle.  You can see no augmentations or
anything that would suggest him not being a human from here.  At the other
end of the hall is another elevator.  You can see the glint of its steel
doors from here and you hope that this is the last level.

#ROOM
Vnum 11143
Name The fourth floor of the tower~
Desc As you approach the figure you can now indeed see that he is only a
human.  He is most likely Valentine Wolf, the leader of the Wolf clan.  He
is said to be the biggest drug user in the Empire.  There isn't a chemical
around that he hasn't tried.  Of course this includes battle drugs so there
is no telling how strong or fast he is.

Name The fourth floor of the tower~
Desc This is indeed the renowned Valentine.  Ruthless and violent he is a
killer and a drug user.  He recently inherited the command of the clan after
he killed his father in a battle.  No one knows much about his fighting
skills but they are probably high above average.  The drugs that he takes
makes his body superpowered and enable him to do extraordinary things.

combatants.  The elevator doors seem like a comfort now and you realize that
you are only a few feet away from your freedom.  They gleam in the light of
the hall and you hope and pray that they will take you back to the main

located.  Nothing much is known of the bunker except it is nearly impossible
to enter.  Farther down this street lies the imperial starbay.

Desc As you walk farther down the street you see fewer rebels and more
imperial guards.  This is most likely because you are nearing the Imperial
Bunker.  It is said that no one is able to access the bunker that is not
invited and so far that statement has been true.  To the north and east you
can see the glint of the landing dock lights coming from the starport. 
Golgotha houses the largest starport in the empire and it acts as the main
train hub for it also.

Desc As you go farther and farther north you can see the quality of living
improving.  The houses at this end are nicer and there is no trash on the
streets.  This may be because of the nearness to the imperial bunker, but
there is no certain way to tell.  You can see the clan towers to the
southwest and the stardock to the northeast.  In front of you is a vast
concrete dome that covers the bunker.

see that the giant doors have been broken down.  They were supposedly
unbreakable but things in the empire rarely tell the truth.  There are still
many guards outside of the bunker protecting it from any further assaults.

man it is supposedly able to withstand any attack upon it.  However, you can
see that the force shield protecting it has been destroyed and the giant
doors that led to it are broken.  Probably the work of rebel espers the once
indestructable fortress has been breached.

it tower over you, dwarfing you like an insignificant bug.  Several of the

can't tell for sure.  It is deathly quiet and you nothing breaks the
silence, not even the sounds of alarms.  If you continue down this corridor
you will eventually reach the train station that takes people to Lionstone's
