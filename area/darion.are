Titan Mindflayer~
A gargantua mindflayer is here.
~
Your light source is barely able to pierce the veil of darkness that is
all around you.  You can just see about 10 feet infront of you.  You stop
for a moment as you hear a scream, that seems to eminate from right in front
of you.  Taking a few more steps you come across the remains of a humanoid
form.  You gasp in horror as you realize whatever did this could still be in
the area.

Your light source is barely able to pierce the veil of darkness that is all around you. You can just see about 10 feet infront of you. You stop for a moment as you hear a scream, that seems to eminate from right in front of you. Taking a few more steps you come across the remains of a humanoid form. You gasp in horror as you realize whatever did this could still be in the area.

Pools of Illiensiene~
After dealing with king kong squid, this chamber seems to have been
carved out by water.  Numerous pools lie about.  Ranging anywhere from 5
feet across to 60 feet across.  As you work your way through the weave of
pools, you hear the sounds of trickling water from behind you.  Then a sound
of something wet smacking the ground.  Turning you seem a giant mass of
brains, with tentacles the length of dragons coming off it.  It seems to be
heading for you.

This is the first lite area that you've encountered since wandering the
depths of the area.  It is a large uncut chamber.  The only thing that
dominates the area, is a large door carved of ivory.  The door depicts a
scene of a giant brain with tentacles being worshipped by some type of
humanoid figures.  Well do you turn back and face the tunnels or do you let
your curiousity run rampant?  By the way, I forgot to mention the giant
Mindflayer sitting off to the side looking at you hungerily.

Your light source is barely able to pierce the veil of darkness that is
all around you.  You can just see about 10 feet infront of you.  You stop
for a moment as you hear a scream, that seems to eminate from right in front
of you.  Taking a few more steps you come across the remains of a humanoid
form.  You gasp in horror as you realize whatever did this could still be in
the area.

Enterance of Horror~
Only a thing shaft of light penetrates the gloom that encompasses you.
The pressing darkness seems to be almost alive.  You can make out the glow
of red beady eyes in the dark.  Sounds the like of which you've never heard.
It is almost unbearable.  Do you climb back up or do you trudge on to find
the treasures that may lie down here?

Door to the Keeper of Tomes~
After braving all the horrors of this place you've finally come to what
is hopefully the treasure room.  A massive oaken door carved with grotesque
seens dominates your sight.  Standing infront of the door is a massive
Illithid waiting to remove your knowledge through your eyes and ears.  Damn
it always has to be a guardian.  Well do you slay him and get the key you
need or just leave like nothing ever happened?

writhing tentacles.  WEll...  Do you run like a little school girl back to

Leaving the niceties of the fireplace and easy chair, you stumble into
the hall of hanging.  Here littered casually about are galloes of all makes
and sizes.  As a mater of fact, a gentleman is here waiting to see you for a
noose fitting.  Well do you be a hero and kick his can or run screaming like
a school girl in a direction?

The Library~
Entering through the small door in the book, you come into a vast
chamber.  The ceilings reaching as far as the eye could see.  Shelves upon
shelves, upon shelves, of books dominated this place.  The thing that
disturbs you the most is a lack of a living breathing presence.  To the east
and west hallways run.

Congrats you grew some hair, the gods are indeed.  You feel the surge of
adrenalin coursing through your veins, as you take in the wonderous sights
of the Colorless Wastes.  *Clink...  Clink...  Clink* What is the seven
heavens is that noise.  Peering towards the castle you see a huge
bastillista aimed directly at your hide.  What ya gonna do now.  There
aren't any of those Kalimari walking around to ask for help?  A: Turn around
and walkaway causully or B: Make like a bat out of hell, and book (get it

The store is lined up in neat orderly glass cases, racks, and numerous
shelves.  You can almost hear the hum of magic that emminates from
everything.  What catches your eye, is a slender female, with you think some
elven heritage, long black hair, piercing blue eyes, can't be a day over 25.
At once you feel almost a compulsion to purchase something from her,
however, minor it may be.

Sanctuary for the Weary~
You can't believe your eyes.  You've stumbled into a varitable paradise.
Lush green grass, trees over loaded with ripe fruits, and could it be.....
*sip* YES!!!  Water.  You have a sense of wellness here.  A rest from the
endless void of the Wastes, the never ending hounding of Yeth Hounds, and
Spectral Riders.  After having you fill and rest, you notice a path leading
to the north.  Funny you think it wasn't there when you entered the first
time.  What do you do?  Take the path or go back into the Grey Waste?  >

seems to set.  Off in the very far distance you can make out a shimmer on
the horizon.  Its nothing.  Just a mirage.  Okay, maybe it isn't.  Should
you continue on or go back to the Endless Grey Wastes?

beginnings, and all around forces of goodness.  You estimate that your only
a day away or you could return to the harshness that is the Grey Waste.

notice that the mountain reaches far above the cloudline.  If you squint

You path continues north towards the base of the mountain or back south.

that vaguely resembles a horse.  It seems to be fast approaching, you can
here the thunderous hoof beats.  Quickly scanning the area you can head back

Thousands of people seem to be standing in line waiting for something. Suddenly you gasp in realization. You think can this be true, the Wheel of incarnation? As if to answer your question a burly horned giant begins to approach you.
You options are continue through the cavern northward, face the beasty head on, or run for the hills from the direction you just came?

uncover a pile of silver.  Wait did that silver just move.  Staring in awe
and amazement, a serpentine form takes shape.  You think to yourself, "

quartz vein.  Entering into a vast chamber, you can see that this place is
unscathed by the hands of man ( or other creature).  Being careful note to
disturb this natural beauty, you spy a chunk of crystal coming to life.  As
the mound starts to take shape, you notice it to be a very delicate
serpentine creature of beauty.

Trees full of fruit, animals of all types playing with each other, and a large tree in the center of it all beckons you forth. Standing by the tree are three figures. Three elderly men, one dress in Gold, one in Grey, the other in Red. All three, in unision, say ," To leave this place you must conquer each of us."
A path continues behind them toward a structure of jade.

After leaving the bright lights of the plains behind, your eyes are

at night.  Here it is a virtual field day for them.  As you set up camp for
the night, you notice a large, black void moving towards you.  Well you

You are starting to get the feeling of forboding, as you've yet to see
signs of the top of the mountain.  Yet you feel somewhat secure in the fact
that you are 3 quarters of the way there.  You've reached a vast plateau.
It seems to stretch in all directions to the horizon.  You have never really
noticed before, but now you notice that you muscles are killing you.  As you
break out your camping gear, a warm feeling of peace and easiness flows
through you.  Looking across the camp at you, is Dragon of immense beauty
and power.  You get the feeling though that no harm shall come to you.

of the dust and blood.  Getting a good look at him you see a titan of a man
with eight arms.  In each of his mighty arms, he wields weapons of unearthly
make.  You can feel the fear rising, as you realize he is heading your way.

Standing Before the Throne Room~
After overcoming your various trials and tribulations, you finally
arrive at the doors to the master creators room.  You can feel the
excitement rising up inside.  But you also have fear at the unexpected.
What if the creator doesn't want visitors?  Will he vaporize you?  Just a
few things to ponder.

Realm of the Creator~
Gathering your resolve you have entered the chamber of the God of gods.
Staring in disbelief you see a hot tub in one corner, a tanner in the other,
a desk with a P3 Gateway computer, a life time supply of jolt, and a ....  A
scrawny looking man with glasses typing away at the machine???  Thinking
back on everything that you've ever heard, you can barely believe that this
is the God of all gods.  Wait, now that you think about it...  He closely
resembles.....  UGH!!!  Its DARION!!!
