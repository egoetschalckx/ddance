Name Door to the Keeper of Tomes~
Desc After braving all the horrors of this place you've finally come to what
is hopefully the treasure room.  A massive oaken door carved with grotesque
seens dominates your sight.  Standing infront of the door is a massive
Illithid waiting to remove your knowledge through your eyes and ears.  Damn
it always has to be a guardian.  Well do you slay him and get the key you
need or just leave like nothing ever happened?

Lush green grass, trees over loaded with ripe fruits, and could it be.....
*sip* YES!!!  Water.  You have a sense of wellness here.  A rest from the
endless void of the Wastes, the never ending hounding of Yeth Hounds, and
Spectral Riders.  After having you fill and rest, you notice a path leading
to the north.  Funny you think it wasn't there when you entered the first
time.  What do you do?  Take the path or go back into the Grey Waste?  >
